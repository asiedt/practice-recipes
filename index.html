<h1> Enjoy These Recipes </h1>
<p> Welcome to my practice page. <br>
      This is mostly for me to practice CSS but the recipes are there for someone to use, I guess! </p>
<div> White Sauce <br>
      <b> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine <br>
            2 tablespoons all-purpose flour <br>
            1/4 teaspoon salt <br>
            Dash black pepper <br>
            1 1/2 cups milk <br> <br>
            </b>
In a small saucepan melt butter. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Stir in milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly.
      Cook and stir for 1 minute more. </div>
<div>
      Chocolate-Sour Cream Frosting <br>
      <b> 1 12-ounce package (2 cups) semisweet chocolate pieces <br>
            1/2 cup butter <br>
            1 8-ounce carton dairy sour cream <br>
            4 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar (about 1 pound) <br>
      </b>
      In a large saucepan melt chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring frequently. Cool for 5 minutes. 
      Stir in sour cream. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until smooth. This frost tops and sides of two 8-or 9-inch cake layers. 
      (Halve the recipe to frost a 13x9x2-inch cake.) Cover and store frosted cake in the refrigerator. </div>
